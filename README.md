# Hello friend! Have you heard the good news about Function Programming?

Created using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

## Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that
presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set
up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits
to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (1.0.0 or later)

4. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   $ git clone git@github.com:mdjnewman/have-you-heard.git && cd have-you-heard
   ```

6. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

8. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port 8001`.
